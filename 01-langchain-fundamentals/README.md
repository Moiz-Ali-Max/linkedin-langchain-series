# ðŸ“˜ LangChain Lecture 01: Document & Data Loaders

This folder contains code examples on **LangChain Document/Data Loaders**.  
The goal is to understand how we can load data from different sources into LangChain.

### Installation Guide
- ``` conda create -n environment-name python=3.11 ```
- ``` conda activate environment-name ```

- ``` pip install --upgrade "langchain>=0.3,<0.4"```
- ``` pip install --upgrade "langchain-community>=0.3,<0.4" ```
- ``` pip install --upgrade "langchain-text-splitters>=0.3,<0.4" ```

## ðŸ”Ž What are Document Loaders?
Document loaders are **helpers** in LangChain that bring data from files, webpages, APIs, or databases into a format the LLM can work with.  

Think of them like **import tools**:
- PDF Loader â†’ read PDF files
- Web Loader â†’ fetch webpage content
- CSV Loader â†’ read rows from spreadsheets
- Markdown / HTML / JSON Loaders â†’ structured text files
- Directory Loader â†’ multiple files at once
- Microsoft Office Loaders â†’ Word, PowerPoint, Excel
- Custom Loader â†’ build your own from any source
